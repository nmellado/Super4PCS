HISTORY
 
 This is a software package for HEALPix, the Hierarchical, Equal Area, and 
 iso-Latitude Pixelation of the sphere, which was  originally devised 
 in early 1997 by Krzysztof M. Gorski at the Theoretical Astrophysics 
 Center in Copenhagen. Early development of the HEALPix concept and initial 
 implementation was made in the spring of 1997 in  collaborative work 
 of KMG, currently at JPL with Eric Hivon, currently at IAP. Benjamin D. Wandelt,
 currently at IAP, has contributed critically to the 
 further development of HEALPix and related mathematical methods.

 The  HEALPix-based  methods  contained  in  the  present  package,  their 
 implementation in Fortran90, IDL, C, C++ and java routines and codes, and documentation 
 were developed jointly by: 
 Anthony J. Banday (banday@mpa-garching.mpg.de),
 Matthias Bartelmann (mbartelmann@ita.uni-heidelberg.de),
 Hans Kristian Eriksen (h.k.k.eriksen@astro.uio.no),
 Krzysztof M. Gorski (krzysztof.m.gorski@jpl.nasa.gov),
 Frode K. Hansen (fhansen@mpa-garching.mpg.de), 
 Eric Hivon (hivon@iap.fr),
 William O'Mullane (womullan@skysrv.pha.jhu.edu),
 Martin Reinecke (martin@mpa-garching.mpg.de), and
 Benjamin D. Wandelt (bwandelt@iap.fr).
