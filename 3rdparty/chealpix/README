Compilation and Installation
----------------------------

See the header in the 'subs/Makefile'.

You can alternatively try to run the script 'doinstall'

Usage
-----

To use in your 'c' code, include the line

#include "chealpix.h"

in your code and link with something like 

gcc -o myprog myprog.c -I<incdir> -L<libdir> -lchealpix

where <incdir> is where you've installed the '.h' files and 
<libdir> is where you've installed the libraries (See the header of 
the 'Makefile').

You will also need the 'cfitsio' library. See 
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html

Disclaimer and Acknowledgements:
--------------------------------

The original HEALPix Fortran90 software was written by Gorski, Hivon, Hansen,
Stompor, Banday and Bartelmann. The 'C' routines are an adaptation of parts of
the Healpix C++ library, done by Martin Reinecke.
