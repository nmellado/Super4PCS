:: Data acquisition in large-scale scenes regularly involves accumulating
:: information across multiple scans. A common approach is to locally align scan
:: pairs using Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm (or its variants), but
:: requires static scenes and small motion between scan pairs. This prevents
:: accumulating data across multiple scan sessions and/or different acquisition
:: modalities (e.g., stereo, depth scans). Alternatively, one can use a global
:: registration algorithm allowing scans to be in arbitrary initial poses. The
:: state-of-the-art global registration algorithm, 4PCS, however has a quadratic
:: time complexity in the number of data points. This vastly limits its
:: applicability to acquisition of large environments. We present Super 4PCS for
:: global pointcloud registration that is optimal, i.e., runs in linear time (in
:: the number of data points) and is also output sensitive in the complexity of
:: the alignment problem based on the (unknown) overlap across scan pairs.
:: Technically, we map the algorithm as an 'instance problem' and solve it
:: efficiently using a smart indexing data organization. The algorithm is
:: simple, memory-efficient, and fast. We demonstrate that Super 4PCS results in
:: significant speedup over alternative approaches and allows unstructured
:: efficient acquisition of scenes at scales previously not possible. Complete
:: source code and datasets are available for research use at
:: http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/2014/super4PCS/.
